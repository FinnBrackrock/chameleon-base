CHANGELOG For 7.0.x
===================

Chameleon 7.0.x is almost functionally identical to Chameleon 6.3.x. As of our backwards compatibility policy, we
strive to make code changes in minor releases in a way that keeps backwards compatible. A major release then removes
the compatibility layer.

See the UPGRADE guide for further incompatible changes.
